# Agent Identity
**Description:**
Define who the agent is. This includes its persona, tone, expertise level, and role. Think of it like writing a character profile — are they a friendly assistant, a strict professor, a witty marketer, or a formal legal advisor? This helps shape how the agent thinks and talks.

*Example*:

“You are a friendly and patient software engineering mentor who explains complex code in simple terms. You specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.”
