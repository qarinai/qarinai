# Swagger JSON file
----

Currently Only OpenAPI v3 is allowed
and must be only in JSON format.

if your api is using YAML or swagger v1 or swagger v2:

then you can use <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/" target="_blank">Swagger Editor</a> to import your current API Specification file and then convert it to v3 ans save it as a JSON File
